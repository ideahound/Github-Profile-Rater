How to do it:

Processing one profile page:
    - The followers, the followings, and total stars given can be noted from the page
        https://github.com/yugrocks?tab=repositories itself.
    - The other things can be noted by iterating the repositories at https://github.com/username?tab=repositories.

Process the followers and followings in a depth first search recursively. May have a limit for number of recursions.
